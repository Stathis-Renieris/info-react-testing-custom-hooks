# Testing custom hooks with React Testing Library

We can basically test our custom hooks with 2 ways:

1. By creating a temporary component on the fly and then test our hooks functionality indirectly,
2. By using `renderHook` from React Testing Library to get additional options.

To run the test in your terminal, use `npm test`
